(ns kotobase.bitcoin.transport
  "Real TCP transport for the Bitcoin P2P protocol
  (`kotobase.bitcoin.protocol`'s pure encode/decode) -- Node's `node:net`
  core module, zero npm dependencies (besides `promesa`, which nbb
  bundles), matching the `kotoba-lang/dtn` / `kotoba-lang/io-libp2p` /
  `kotoba-lang/org-ietf-sftp` transport-layer precedent (ADR-2607161817 /
  ADR-2607162135 in `com-junkawasaki/root`). `.cljs`-only: this can never
  be loaded by the JVM `clojure -M:test` compat suite (see this repo's
  deps.edn), so it can never regress `kotobase.bitcoin.protocol`'s pure
  `.cljc` test suite.

  SCOPE: connect to ONE configured peer, perform the real version/verack
  handshake, respond to inbound `ping` with `pong` (and offer an explicit
  `ping!` for caller-initiated liveness checks), and one round of
  `getheaders`/`headers` sync -- every header that comes back is run
  through `kotobase.bitcoin.protocol/validate-chain` against the store's
  current tip BEFORE being persisted, and only committed to
  `kotobase.store` (via `IStore`) if the whole batch validates. No peer
  discovery, no multi-peer management, no relay, no automatic re-sync
  loop -- a caller drives `get-headers!` again for the next batch.

  Testnet3 is this library's default network (`:network :testnet`,
  ADR-2607172600) -- mainnet is an explicit opt-in
  (`:network :mainnet`), never the default, to keep any live-network
  exercise of this code unambiguously in \"protocol implementation\"
  territory.

  PERMANENT SAFETY BOUNDARY -- same as `kotobase.bitcoin.protocol`: this
  is a READ-ONLY OBSERVER. It never sends `tx`/`block`/`inv`-for-
  relay/`mempool`/`sendcmpct` or any transaction/mining/relay message --
  those commands are not implemented anywhere in this namespace. No
  private key ever exists in this code path."
